>Dynamic libraries are the new kid on the block, as these things go, arriving on the Unix scene circa 1985.   Like a static library, a dynamic library is a collection of functions with a table of contents.  They are referenced at build time to give the executatble information about how they will eventually be used, but they aren't <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>used</I
></SPAN
> until run time.  </P
><P
>Dynamic libraries are part of the run-time environment.  When a program is run, the run-time linker finds the dynamic libraries needed by the program, finds the addresses of the required functions, and assembles a runable image in memory.  Missing libraries and/or missing functions &mdash; or the wrong versions of them &mdash; can lead to head-scratching and other amusing behavior.  </P
><P
>In Windows&reg; dynamic libraries are called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>dynamic link libraries</I
> (DLLs).  In Unix they're normally called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>shared objects</I
>.  But they're roughly the same thing.    </P

CLASS="emphasis"

> file is maintained by hand, by the programmer, and is used to generate a library.  The header file and associated library are distributed and installed together (one hopes), but correct installation and subsequent use by the compiler &amp; linker require human beings to keep track of the pair.  Failure to do so leads to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"interesting"</SPAN
> development and even run-time problems, especially with libraries whose functions' parameters change from version to version. </P
><P
>For example, imagine a function <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>f(int g)</TT
> defined in library <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libf.so</TT
> and declared in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>f.h</TT

CLASS="FILENAME"
>libf.so</TT
>, the function's parameter is changed to use a pointer, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>f(int *p)</TT
>, and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>f.h</TT
> is likewise updated.  Possible errors that cannot be prevented by the linker include: 

<P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>An old program could use the new library.  Probably the integer it passes will be interpreted as an out-of-bounds address, resulting in a segmentation violation.   </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>A new program could use the old library, passing an address that the library interprets as an integer.  Hillarity ensues.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Existing source code could be compiled using the old header file but linked to the new library.  If you've never done that, give it time.   </P
></LI
></OL
>

These errors are possible because C functions are identified to the linker <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>by name only</I
></SPAN
>.  On the upside, that makes the tools simple and easy to implement and, by the same token, simplifies the use of C libraries by other languages.  The downside is that the work of ensuring that the right libraries are used becomes an administrative task instead of a technical one.   </P
