CLASS="QUOTE"
>"8-bit <ACRONYM

>The upshot is, there is no uniform standard, no agreement on the meaning of a byte, particularly if that byte's value is greater than 127.  Let's say your client machine sends <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HELLO</TT
> and your database stores it as  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>72 69 76 76 79</TT
>.  When another client retrieves that value, it will convert it into human-readable form by applying an encoding standard.  If everything's tightly wrapped, it will use the very same encoding that your database used (and the same one you had in mind when you sent it), and that client will also see <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HELLO</TT
>.  If things are not so tightly wrapped but that client is fortunate enough to be using a similar standard to what you were using, say, ISO 8859-1, he'll still see <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>HELLO</TT
>.  Most languages based on the Roman alphabet can be represented by ISO 8859-1, and are thus interchangeable.  Beyond that, things get quickly messy.  Greek clients, for one, are not so lucky: there are three ISO 8859 standards for Greek, all mutually incompatible.

>Database servers need to know what encoding standard to employ, too.  It's not obvious at first, but notions like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"uppercase"</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"lowercase"</SPAN
>, trailing blanks, and collation rules all depend on what letter is meant by what number.  (Collation even depends on what culture is interpreting the letters.)</P
