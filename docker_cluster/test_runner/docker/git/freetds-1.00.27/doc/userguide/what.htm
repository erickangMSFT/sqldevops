><ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bits on the wire"</SPAN
>, how data flow.</P
><P
>In reading this manual, it may be helpful to keep in mind that a protocol is not an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
>, although the two are related.  The server recognizes and speaks a protocol; anything that can send it the correct combination of bytes in the right order can communicate with it.  But programmers aren't generally in the business of sending bytes; that's the job of a library.  Over the years, there have been a few libraries &mdash; each with its own <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
> &mdash; that do the work of moving SQL through a <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
> pipe.  <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
>, and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>CT-Library</SPAN
> have very different <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
>s, but they're all one to the server, because on the wire they speak <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
>.</P
><P
>The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
> protocol was designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SQL Server</SPAN
> relational database engine in 1984.  The problem Sybase faced then still exists: There was no commonly accepted application-level protocol to transfer data between a database server and its client.  To encourage the use of their product, Sybase came up with <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
>.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
> provided an <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
> to the client program, and communicated with the server.  What it sent to the server took the form of a stream of bytes meant for tables of data, a Tabular Data Stream.</P
><P
>In 1990 Sybase entered into a technology sharing agreement with Microsoft which resulted in Microsoft marketing its own <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SQL Server</SPAN
>. Microsoft kept the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
> <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
> and added <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
>.  (Microsoft has since added other <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
>s, too.  It no longer supports its own <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
> implementation.) At about the same time, Sybase introduced a more powerful <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"successor"</SPAN
> to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
>, called <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>CT-Library</SPAN
>, and called the pair <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
><I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>CT-Library</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DB-Library</SPAN
>, and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
> are <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</ACRONYM
>s that &mdash; however different their programming style may be &mdash; all communicate with the server in the same way.  The language they use is <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
>.</P
><P
>The <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</ACRONYM
> protocol comes in several flavors, most of which were not openly documented.  If anything, it was considered to be something like a trade secret, or at least proprietary technology.  The exception is <ACRONYM
